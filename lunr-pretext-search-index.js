The limit can be approximated to be 1 because the data in the table and the graph show that from the left and the right the function approaches 1 as goes to 2.

We also say that is a local maximum value for the function. On the other hand, we say that has a local minimum at provided that for all near . We also say that is a local minimum value for the function. The local maxima and minima are also known as the local extrema (or relative extrema) of the function.     To find the extreme values of a function we can consider all its local extrema (local maxima and minima) and study them to find which one(s) give the largest and smallest values on the function. But how do you find the local\/relative extrema? We will see that we can detect local extrema by computing the first derivative and finding the critical points of the function. By finding the critical points, we will produce a list of candidates for the extrema of the function.    We have encountered several terms recently, so we should make sure that we understand how they are related. Which of the following statements are true?   In a closed interval an endpoint is always a local extrema but it might or might not be a global extremum.    In a closed interval an endpoint is always a global extremum.    A critical point is always a local extremum but it might or might not be a global extremum.    A local extremum only occurs where the first derivative is equal to zero.    A local extremum always occurs at a critical point.    A local extremum might occur at a critical point or at an endpoint of a closed interval.       Increasing\/Decreasing  increasing  decreasing   Let be a differentiable function on the interval . is increasing on the interval if , and decreasing on if .      This activity will develop the intuition for the First Derivative Test , a method of classifying local extrema. The questions below refer to this prompt:  Sketch the graph of a continuous function which has the following properties:    and      has a local maximum at      is neither increasing nor decreasing at      has a local minimum at        Which is the most accurate description for how the graph behaves around ?    before and after      before , at , and after      before and after      before , at , and after        Which is the most accurate description for how the graph behaves around ?    before and after      before , , and after      before and after      before , , and after        Which is the most accurate description for how the graph behaves around ?    before , at , and after      before and after      before and after      before , at , and after         First Derivative Test  First Derivative Test   Suppose that is a critical point of and that is continuous at .

If switches from positive to negative around , then has a local maximum at     If does not switch sign around , then has neither a local maximum nor a local minimum at ; the most we can say is that it has a horizontal tangent line .         This activity will walk you through how to use to classify local extrema.  Let .    The first thing to do is to find the critical inputs for , then organize them on a number line. Which number line is most accurate for this function?

There should be 4 total if you chose A, B, D, or E; there should be 3 if you chose C or F.    Choose an value which lies in each of the intervals you chose. For each interval, determine: is positive or negative at the test point? Record your answers with the number line in some fashion.    On which interval(s) is increasing? What about the interval(s) where is decreasing? Record your answers with the number line in some fashion.    Use part (d) to classify all critical points of as local maxima, local minima, or neither.    Sketch a rough graph of based on the information you've collected to this point.     Second Derivative Test  Second Derivative Test   Suppose that is a critical input for and that is continuous at . Then,     If , then has a local maximum at .    If , then has a local minimum at .

Then identify any local extrema using either the First or Second Derivative Test.          on                     Concavity  concave up  concave down  concavity   A function is said to be concave up if it bends upward away from its tangent lines; if it bends downward away from its tangent lines, we say is concave down .

Conduct the Concavity Test on to determine the intervals on which is concave up and concave down.    Does have any inflection points? Where and why?      For each function: 1) identify the intervals where it is increasing\/decreasing; 2) classify any extrema for the function; 3) identify the intervals where it is concave up\/concave down; 4) identify the inflection points, if any; 5) use the information to give a rough sketch of the graph.

We now note that whenever we know the derivative of a function, we have a function-derivative pair , so we also know the antiderivative of a function. For instance, we determined a derivative pair in . Every elementary derivative rule leads us to a function-derivative pair, and thus to a known antiderivative\/indefinite integral.     In the following activity, we work to build a list of basic functions whose antiderivatives we may already know.

This activity will develop the parallelogram rule , a method for visualizing the addition or subtraction of two vectors.  Consider the vectors and for the tasks below.    Find .    On a coordinate grid, draw the vectors and so that their tails are touching.    Create a parallelogram by translating and , then include on the parallelogram. What do you notice about its position on the diagram?    Compute . How, if at all, does it fit in the diagram from (c)?     Vector Properties  Let and be three vectors, and let be scalar values. The following properties hold:   (Commutativity of Vectors)     (Associativity of Vectors)     (Additive Identity for Vectors)     (Additive Inverse for Vectors)     (Associativity of Scalar Muliplication)     (Distributivity)     (Distributivity)     (Multiplicative Identity for Vectors)     (Multiplicative Zero for Vectors)        A convenient thing about working with vectors is that the same ideas that work in two dimensions work in any number of dimensions. The number of dimensions is equal to the number of components in the vector. For example, the vector is two-dimensional because there are only two components, while the vector is six-dimensional because there are six components.     For the vectors , , find the following.                                          In order to avoid confusion, we talk about a three-dimensional coordinate system using the right-hand rule : when using your right hand, point your index finger out, thumb up, and middle finger perpendicular to both. Your index finger represents the axis, your middle finger represents the axis, and your thumb represents the axis.        Recall from that the magnitude or length of a two-dimensional vector can be found by computing .    For a three-dimensional vector , how might you compute ?    Find the length of the vector .    What is the length of the vector ?      A unit vector is a vector with unit length, i.e. length exactly 1.      For each vector, find its associated unit vector.                         The unit vector is the vector whose first component 1 and all others are 0, is the one whose second component is 1 with all others 0, and is the one whose third component is 1 with all others 0.     Write each vector as a sum of the standard unit vectors .                                                                           The speed of an object is the magnitude of its associated velocity vector. A football is thrown by a player with an initial speed of 82 miles per hour and an angle of elevation of . Determine the velocity vector in miles per hour and express in component form and in terms of the standard unit vectors. Assume the ball is thrown in the plane.    Which of the following best expresses the horizontal component of the vector?                                    Which option best describes the vertical component of the vector?                                    Use your answers to (a) and (b) to write the velocity vector in component form.    Use your answers to (a) and (b) to write the velocity vector using the standard unit vectors. Remember that the ball is thrown in the plane.    Why would we consider the ball to be thrown in the plane rather than the plane or the plane?      In order to fly from Oklahoma City to Dayton, OH, a plane must fly east of north. A plane leaves Oklahoma City at a ground speed of 525 miles per hour. A 30 mph wind blows from the north during the flight.    What is the ground speed of the plane when the wind begins to blow?    What is the new bearing of the plane?      An object is said to be in static equilibrium if the resultant force of the forces that act on it is zero. Let , , and be three forces acting on an object. Find the resultant force necessary to place the object in static equilibrium.      "
