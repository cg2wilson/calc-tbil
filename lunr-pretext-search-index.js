We can usually determine the value of an indeterminate form using some algebraic manipulations of the expression given.   A function has a hole hole at if does not exist but does exist and is equal to a real number.  The function has a hole at because is not defined but so the limit exists and is equal to a real number. Notice that is also an example of a limit giving an indeterminate form which we could then compute using an algebraic manipulation of the function given.    Determine the following limits and explain your reasoning.         In activity you studied the velocity of Usain Bolt in his Beijing 100 meters dash. We will now study this situation analytically. To make our computations simpler, we will approximate that he could run 100 meters in 10 seconds and we will consider the model , where is the distance in meters and is the time in seconds.   The average velocity is the ratio distance covered over time elapsed. If we consider the interval that starts at and has width , written , the average velocity on this interval is . The instantaneous velocity at time is given by:  .    Compute the average velocity on the interval . We think of this interval as for the value of .    Compute the average velocity starting at 5 seconds, but now with seconds.    We want to study the instantaneous velocity at seconds. Find an expression for the average velocity on the interval , where is an unspecified value.    Expand your expression. When , you can simplify it!    Recall that the instantaneous velocity is the limit of your expression as . Find the instantaneous velocity given by this model at seconds.    The model does not really capture the real-world situation. Think of at least one reason why this model does not fit the scenario of Usain Bolt's 100 meters dash.     "
